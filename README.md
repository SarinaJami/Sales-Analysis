# Sales-Analysis
Created an Interactive Tableau Dashboard for a Sales DataSource.

Dashboard is available on https://sarinajami.github.io/Sales-Analysis/

**Dashboard Guide:**

* There are two navigation buttons on the right upper corner of the dashboard by which users can switch between Sales Dashboard and Customer Dashboard.
* Sales Dashboard includes information about monthly trends of sales, profit, and sales quantity over the current and the previous years. There is a bar chart indicating sales and profit by subcategory, as well as, a weekly trends of sales and profit which is color coded above and below the average.
* Customer Dashboard includes information about number of customers, sales per customers, and number of orders over the current and the previous year. There is a histogram indicating number of customers based on number of orders, as well as, a detailed table for the top 10 customers.
* There is a filter on the right upper corner by which users can filter data through year, product, and location.
* The two charts down the dashboard act as filters as well.
